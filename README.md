# A Simple Drawing Software

This is my computer graphics work. A simple drawing software.

This is the UI made by Qt designer. I use the Pyqt5 to build this software. 

This drawing software can draw basic geometric figures.

**Note**: The current software works well with Pyqt5+python3.7.3

## File

**main_Simple2D.py**: This is the main file. You can use the software by using `python main_Simple2D.py`

**drawwidget.py**: This is the drawing file. All the drawing actions are written in this file.

**history.py**: This file is made for record all the operation so that we can go back or recover what we do.

**simple2ddoc.py**: This file is for saving our figures.

The remaining files are different classes for the geometric figures.

The structure is:

There are many bugs in this software. And I may fix them in the future.
